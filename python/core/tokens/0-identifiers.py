    Note: Identifiers cannot be a keyword.

6. The length of an identifier should not exceed 31 characters.
7. spical symbols are not allowed.

Example:

    Valid identifiers: identifier1, identifier2, identifier3
    Invalid identifiers: 1identifier, 123identifier, identifier@, identifier#


Note: The above code is a valid Python program containing identifiers. It uses keywords and valid identifiers to demonstrate the rules of identifiers in Python.
